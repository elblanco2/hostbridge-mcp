# Arc MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that simplifies framework deployments on various hosting environments, with a focus on shared hosting.

## Overview

Arc bridges the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and hosting environments, allowing novice developers to deploy web applications easily through conversational interfaces. It implements the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) to expose tools, resources, and prompts that guide users through the deployment process.

### Key Features

- **Framework Support**: Deploy Wasp applications with ease, with planned support for more frameworks
- **Multi-Provider**: Support for Netlify, Vercel, traditional shared hosting environments, and Hostm.com
- **Guided Deployments**: Prompts to guide users through the deployment process
- **Authentication Management**: Secure storage of hosting provider credentials
- **Troubleshooting**: Built-in tools to diagnose and fix common deployment issues
- **Focused on Shared Hosting**: Simplified deployment to traditional shared hosting environments

## Status

This project is currently in early development. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- MCP Client (e.g., Claude Desktop)
- Hosting provider accounts as needed

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/elblanco2/arc-mcp.git
cd arc-mcp

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your configuration:

```
SECURE_STORAGE_PATH=~/.arc/credentials
```

### Usage

#### Running from command line

```bash
# Start the server directly
arc

# With debug logging
arc --debug

# With a custom storage path
arc --secure-storage-path=/path/to/credentials
```

#### Using with Claude Desktop

1. Edit your Claude Desktop configuration file:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add Arc server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "arc": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "-m",
        "arc",
        "--debug"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude Desktop.

4. Start conversations with Claude about deploying your applications!

## Architecture

Arc is built on a modular architecture:

- **Credentials Manager**: Securely stores and retrieves provider credentials
- **Framework Handlers**: Framework-specific deployment logic
- **Hosting Providers**: Provider-specific deployment operations
- **MCP Interface**: Exposes tools, resources, and prompts via the Model Context Protocol
